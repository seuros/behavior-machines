//! Bit algebra and comparisons over the circuit arena.
//!
//! Everything a lowered behavior tree computes is a bit or a small count, so
//! the builder works in [`Bit`]s: affine forms carrying the invariant that
//! they hold exactly 0 or 1. The invariant is what makes the constructions
//! here cheap.
//!
//! Two identities do most of the work, and both rely on the operand being a
//! **non-negative integer**, which every count in a lowered tree is:
//!
//! ```text
//! [count == 0]  = max(0, 1 - count)              one ReLU
//! [count >= k]  = max(0, count - k + 1) - max(0, count - k)
//! ```
//!
//! The first is the whole reason selection is shallow. A general `==` needs
//! two comparisons and four `ReLUs`; a test against zero, which is what
//! "nothing earlier matched" reduces to, needs one operation.
