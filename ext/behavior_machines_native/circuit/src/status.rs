//! The three-valued status, as bits.
//!
//! A node's result is encoded as three bits of which **at most one** is set.
//! All three zero means the node was not ticked this tick, which a tree walk
//! expresses by simply not calling the node and a circuit has to carry
//! explicitly: every node's slot exists in every tick whether it ran or not.
//!
//! Keeping "not ticked" as the all-zero case rather than a fourth bit is what
//! makes [`StatusBits::ticked`] a free sum and lets unticked children fall out
//! of the ordered-composite arithmetic for nothing: a child before the cursor
//! contributes 0 to every count it appears in.
